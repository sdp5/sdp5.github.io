## GreenGovRAG

GreenGovRAG is an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform designed specifically for Australian environmental and planning regulations. It lets users ask natural-language questions and delivers accurate, citation-backed answers. The system supports geo-aware filtering (state, LGA, region), ESG-related queries (climate, water, biodiversity, emissions), and uses hybrid search combining BM25 and vector similarity. It is cloud-agnostic (AWS, Azure, Docker), supports multiple LLM providers, and is fully open source for contributors, civic-tech groups, and researchers.

> Empowers planners, consultants, and researchers with accurate, location-aware answers to complex Australian environmental and planning regulations in seconds instead of days.
